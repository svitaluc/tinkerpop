= Processed Result Logging

Processed Result Logging enables to silently perform an additional operation on
a result of a query and to log the outcome of this additional operation in a
predefined format.

In order to successfully log an outcome of an additional operation, the operation
must be supported for processed result logging. A <<List of supported methods>>
is part of
this readme, but it is not difficult to extend a specific interface with another
method (for further information see section <<For Developers>>).

It is possible to use a provided format or to create a custom implementation of
a format in order to log various type of information. A <<List of provided formats>>
is part of this readme.

For business purposes a method can provide an anonymized log of the processed result,
so that the sensitive data wouldn't be exposed.
The <<List of supported methods>> contains the information if the method
supports anonymous logging or not.


== List of supported methods

Currently supported methods for processing a result, their full processor names and
if they support anonymized logging:

[.result]
====
* path
  ** - org.apache.tinkerpop.gremlin.server.processedResultLogging.processor.PathProcessor
  ** - supports anonymized logging
====

For detailed information see section <<Methods>>.

== List of provided formats

Currently supported formats for processed result logging are:

[.result]
====
* basic
  ** - org.apache.tinkerpop.gremlin.server.processedResultLogging.formatter.BasicProcessedResultFormatter
* query
  ** - org.apache.tinkerpop.gremlin.server.processedResultLogging.formatter.QueryProcessedResultFormatter
====

For description of the formats see section <<Formats>>.

== Settings

In order to set a processed result logging, corresponding options must be
set in a yaml configuration file.

The configuration file to be adjusted is `conf/gremlin-server.yaml`.

=== enabled
A required property when you want to use Processed Result Logging is
the property

`processedResultLog.enabled`

`default value: false`

If you want to log processed results, the `enabled` property must be set to `true`.

=== processor
An optional property determining the method to be run on a result is

`processedResultLog.processor`

`default value: org.apache.tinkerpop.gremlin.server.processedResultLogging.processor.PathProcessor`

Argument of the `processor`
property is the full name name of a class providing the processed result logging.
So it is a class implementing the ResultProcessor interface.


=== format
An optional property setting a log format is

`processedResultLog.format`

`default value: org.apache.tinkerpop.gremlin.server.processedResultLogging.formatter.BasicProcessedResultFormatter`

See the <<List of provided formats>> and <<Formats>> section for further information.

=== anonymized
An optional property setting an anonymized log is

`processedResultLog.anonymized`

`default value: false`

An anonymized log shouldn't contain any client information about data stored in
the graph.

== Methods

=== path
If a query result is of a GraphTraversal type, a path method is silently performed on the
result and its outcome is logged.
For description of the path step see
link:http://tinkerpop.apache.org/docs/current/reference/#path-step[Documentation].

_Example of a pure path output:_

 v[1], e[7][1-knows->2], v[2], vadas

==== anonymized
An anonymized version of a path method produces output without the last result.

_Example of a pure path output in anonymized mode:_

  v:1,e:7,v:2

== Formats

=== basic
Basic format is logging only a processed result without any other piece of
information.
It can be thus suited for the case when the processedResultLog is logged
into a separate file.

_Example of basic format output:_

 v[1], e[7][1-knows->2], v[2], vadas
 v[1], e[8][1-knows->4], v[4], josh

==== query

Query format logs first query and then its processed results. In order to
determine the two types of information, query is preceded with `QUERY:` line
and the set of processed results is preceded with `PR:` (

_Example of basic format output:_

 #QUERY:
 g.V(1).outE('knows').inV().values('name')
 #PR:
 v:1,e:7,v:2
 v:1,e:8,v:4
